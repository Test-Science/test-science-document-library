The Test Science Document Library comprises all publically available Test Science research papers, slide decks, and presentations. The library has over 100 unique projects.

Publications contain methodological developments, lessons learned, and training materials conducted to advance the theory and practice of rigorous operational and live fire test and evaluation. The library features research conducted with the core Test Science research areas:  Human Systems Interactions, Design of Experiments, Uncertainty Quantification, Reliability Test Planning, Modeling and Simulation Validation, Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, and Data Management.

We hope this resource is a useful compendium test and evaluation community.
