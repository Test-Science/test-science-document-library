### Abstract

We illustrate the construction of Bayesian D-optimal designs for nonlinear models and compare the relative efficiency of standard designs with these designs for several models and prior distributions on the parameters. Through a relative efficiency analysis, we show that standard designs can perform well in situations where the nonlinear model is intrinsically linear. However, if the model is nonlinear and its expectation function cannot be linearized by simple transformations, the nonlinear optimal design is considerably more efficient than the standard design.
