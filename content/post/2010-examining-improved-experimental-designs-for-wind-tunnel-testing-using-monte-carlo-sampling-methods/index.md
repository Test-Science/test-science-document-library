### Abstract

In this paper we compare data from a fairly large legacy wind tunnel test campaign to smaller, statistically-motivated experimental design strategies. The comparison, using Monte Carlo sampling methodology, suggests a tremendous opportunity to reduce wind tunnel test efforts without losing test information.
