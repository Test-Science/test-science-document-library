### Abstract

This presentation shows the merits of applying experimental design to operational tests, guidance on using DOE from the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, and presents the design solution for the test of a chemical agent detector.  It is important to keep in mind the advanced techniques from DOE (split-plot designs, optimal designs) to determine effective DOEs for operational testing; traditional design strategies often result in designs that are not executable.
