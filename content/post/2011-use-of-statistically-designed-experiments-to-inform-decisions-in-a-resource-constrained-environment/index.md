### Abstract
There has been recent emphasis on the increased use of statistics, including the use of statistically designed experiments, to plan and execute tests that support Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The use of statistical methods, including experimental design, has shown great benefits in industry, especially when used in an integrated fashion; for example see the literature on Six Sigma. The structured approach of experimental design allows the user to determine what data need to be collected and how it should be analyzed to achieve specific decision making objectives. This focuses decision making processes, improves test efficiency and provides objective data for evidence-based decision-making. Today the DoD Test and Evaluation (T&E) community is investigating the use of statistical methods to provide efficient and effective testing. This paper discusses the use of statistics in T&E to assist T&E practitioners and acquisition management in understanding how to improve the quantity and quality of information made available to decision makers to make risk assessments, even in a resource constrained environment.
