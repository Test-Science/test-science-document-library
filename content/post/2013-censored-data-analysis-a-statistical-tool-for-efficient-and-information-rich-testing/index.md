### Abstract
Binomial metrics like probability-to-detect or probability-to-hit typically provide operationally meaningful and easy to interpret test outcomes.  However, they are information-poor metrics and extremely expensive to test.  The standard power calculations to size a test employ hypothesis tests, which typically result in many tens to hundreds of runs. In addition to being expensive, the test is most likely inadequate for characterizing performance over a variety of conditions due to the inherently large statistical uncertainties associated with binomial metrics.  A solution is to convert to a continuous variable, such as miss distance or time-to-detect.  The common objection to switching to a continuous variable is that the hit/miss or detect/non-detect binomial information is lost, when the fraction of misses/no-detects is often the most important aspect of characterizing system performance.  Furthermore, the new continuous metric appears to no longer be connected to the requirements document, which was stated in terms of a probability. These difficulties can be overcome with the use of censored data analysis.  This presentation will illustrate the concepts and benefits of this approach, and will illustrate a simple analysis with data, including power calculations to show the cost savings for employing the methodology.
