Acceptance testing of combat helmets presents multiple challenges that require statistically-sound solutions. For example, how should first article and lot acceptance tests treat multiple threats and measures of performance? How should these tests account for multiple helmet sizes and environmental treatments? How closely should first article testing requirements match historical or characterization test data? What government and manufacturer risks are acceptable during lot acceptance testing? Similar challenges arise when testing other components of Personal Protective Equipment and similar statistical approaches should be applied to all components. This presentation explores these questions using operating characteristics curves and simulation studies.
