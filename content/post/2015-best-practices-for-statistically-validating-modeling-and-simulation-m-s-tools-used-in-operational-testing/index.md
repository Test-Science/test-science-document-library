### Abstract
In many situations, collecting sufficient data to evaluate system performance against operationally realistic threats is not possible due to cost and resource restrictions, safety concerns, or lack of adequate or representative threats. Modeling and simulation tools that have been verified, validated, and accredited can be used to supplement live testing in order to facilitate a more complete evaluation of performance. Two key questions that frequently arise when planning an operational test are (1) which (and how many) points within the operational space should be chosen in the simulation space and the live space for optimal ability to verify and validate the M&S, and (2) once that data is collected, what is the best way to compare the live trials to the simulated trials for the purpose of validating the M&S? This conference presentation addresses various strategies for addressing these two questions. The best methodologies for designing and analyzing will vary depending on the goal of operational test, the type of model used in the simulation, and the amount of live and simulated data available.
