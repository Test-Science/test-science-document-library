This briefing provides an example of some of the nuanced issues in reliability estimation in operational testing.  The statistical models are motivated by an example of the Paladin Integrated Management (PIM).  We demonstrate how to use a Bayesian approach to reliability estimation that uses data from all phases of testing.
