### Abstract
Recently Dr. Gilmore, DOT&E, signed out a memo providing Guidance on the Use and Design of Surveys in Operational Test and Evaluation. This guidance memo helps the Human Systems Integration (HSI) community to ensure that useful and accurate HSI data are collected. Information about how HSI experts can leverage the guidance is presented. Specifically, the presentation will cover which HSI metrics can and cannot be answered by surveys.
