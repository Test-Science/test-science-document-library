In an era of reduced budgets and limited testing, verifying that requirements have been met in a single test period can be challenging, particularly using traditional analysis methods that ignore all available information. The Bayesian paradigm is tailor made for these situations, allowing for the combination of multiple sources of data and resulting in more robust inference and uncertainty quantification. Consequently, Bayesian analyses are becoming increasingly popular in T&E. This tutorial briefly introduces the basic concepts of Bayesian Statistics, with implementation details illustrated in R through two case studies: reliability for the Core Mission functional area of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and performance curves for a chemical detector in the Bio-chemical Detection System (BDS) with different agents and matrices. Examples are also presented using STAN, a high-performance open-source software for Bayesian inference on multi-level models.
