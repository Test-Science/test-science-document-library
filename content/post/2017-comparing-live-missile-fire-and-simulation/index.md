Modeling and Simulation is frequently used in Test and Evaluation (T&E) of air-to-air weapon systems to evaluate the effectiveness of a weapons. The AirIntercept Missile-9X (AIM-9X) program uses modeling and simulationextensively to evaluate missile miss distances. Since flight testing isexpensive, the test program uses relatively few flight tests and supplementsthose data with large numbers of miss distances from simulated tests acrossthe weapons operational space. However, before modeling and simulation canbe used to predict performance it must first be validated. Validation isespecially challenging when working with a limited number of live test data. Inthis presentation, we show that even with a limited number of live test points(e.g., 16 missile fires), we can still perform a statistical analysis for thevalidation. We introduce a validation technique known as Fisher's CombinedProbability Test and show how to apply Fisher's test to validate the AIM-9Xmodel and simulation.
