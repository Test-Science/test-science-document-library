### Abstract
This document was prepared to support Dr. Lillard's visit to the NavalPostgraduate School where he will provide a guest lecture to students in the T&Ecourse. The briefing covers three primary themes: 1) evaluation of military systemson the basis of requirements and KPPs alone is often insufficient to determineeffectiveness and suitability in combat conditions, 2) statistical methods are essentialfor developing defensible and rigorous test designs, 3) operational testing is often theonly means to discover critical performance shortcomings.
