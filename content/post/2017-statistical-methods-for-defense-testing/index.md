### Abstract
In the increasingly complex and data‐limited world of military defense testing, statisticians play a valuable role in many applications. Before the DoD acquires any major new capability, that system must undergo realistic testing in its intended environment with military users. Although the typical test environment is highly variable and factors are often uncontrolled, design of experiments techniques can add objectivity, efficiency, and rigor to the process of test planning. Statistical analyses help system evaluators get the most information out of limited data sets. Oftentimes new or complex analysis techniques are needed to support the goal of characterizing or predicting system performance across the operational space. Finally, the growing need for computer models or simulations to supplement live testing also means that these models must be appropriately validated before their output can be deemed sufficient for use. Statistical design and analysis techniques are essential for rigorous evaluation of these models.
