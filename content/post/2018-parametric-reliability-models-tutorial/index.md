### Abstract

This tutorial demonstrates how to plot reliability functions parametrically in R using the output from any reliability modeling software. It provides code and sample plots of reliability and failure rate functions with confidence intervals for three different skewed probability distributions  the exponential, the two-parameter Weibull, and the lognormal. These three distributions are the most common parametric models for reliability or survival analysis. This paper also provides mathematical background for the models and recommendations for when to use them.
