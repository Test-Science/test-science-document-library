Reliability tests determine which factors drive system reliability. Often, the reliability or failure time data collected in these tests tend to follow distinctly non- normal distributions and include censored observations. The experimental design should accommodate the skewed nature of the response and allow for censored observations, which occur when systems under test do not fail within the allotted test time. To account for these design and analysis considerations, Monte Carlo simulations are frequently used to evaluate experimental design properties. Simulation provides accurate power calculations as a function of sample size, allowing researchers to determine adequate sample sizes at each level of the treatment. However, simulation may be inefficient for comparing multiple experiments of various sizes. In this document, we present a closed form approach for calculating power, based on the non- central chi-squared approximation to the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic. The solution can be used to compare multiple designs and accommodate trade-space analyses between power, efTect size, model formulation, sample size, censoring rates, and design type. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we provide a comparison to estimates that are generated using Monte Carlo simulation.
