Engineers use reliability experiments to determine the factors that drive product reliability, build robust products, and predict reliability under use conditions. This article uses recent testing of a Howitzer to illustrate the challenges in designing reliability experiments for complex, repairable systems. We leverage lessons learned from current research and propose methods for designing an experiment for a complex, repairable system.
