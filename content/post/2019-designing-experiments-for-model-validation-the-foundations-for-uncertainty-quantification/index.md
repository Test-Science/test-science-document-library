### Abstract
Advances in computational power have allowed both greater fidelity and more extensive use of such models. Numerous complex military systems have a corresponding models that simulate its performance in the field. In response, the DoD needs defensible practices for validating these models. Design of Experiments and statistical analysis techniques are the foundational building blocks for validating the use of computer models and quantifying uncertainty in that validation. Recent developments in uncertainty quantification have the potential to benefit the DoD in using modeling and simulation to inform operational evaluations.
