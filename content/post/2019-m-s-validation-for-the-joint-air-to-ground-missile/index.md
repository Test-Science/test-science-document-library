An operational test is resource-limited and must therefore rely on both live test data and modeling and simulation (M&S) data to inform a full evaluation.  For the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) system, we needed to create a test design that accomplished dual goals, characterizing missile performance across the operational space and supporting rigorous validation of the M&S.  Our key question is which statistical techniques should be used to compare the M&S to the live data?
