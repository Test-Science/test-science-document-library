Reusing Test and Evaluation (T&E) datasets multiple times at different points throughout a program’s lifecycle is one way to realize their full value. Data management plays an important role in enabling - and even encouraging – this practice. Although Department-level policy on data management is supportive of reuse and consistent with best practices from industry and academia, the documents that shape the day-to-day activities of T&E practitioners are much less so. As a result, reuse of T&E datasets does not occur on a consistent basis or in a formalized way. To fill this apparent gap, this article expands upon four best practices – addressed in different ways in Service-specific T&E policies – that can increase the reuse of T&E datasets.
