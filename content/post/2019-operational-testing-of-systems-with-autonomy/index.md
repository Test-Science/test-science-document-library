### Abstract
Systems with autonomy will pose unique challenges for operational test. This document provides an executive level overview of these issues and the proposed solutions and/or reforms. In order to be ready for the testing challenges of the next century, we will need to change the entire acquisition life cycle, starting even from initial system conceptualization. This briefing was presented to the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation along with his deputies and Chief Scientist.
