### Abstract
Acceptance Sampling by Variables (ASbV) is a statistical testing technique used in Personal Protective Equipment programs to determine the quality of the equipment in First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests. This article intends to remedy the lack of existing references that discuss the similarities between ASbV and certain techniques used in different sub-disciplines within statistics. Understanding ASbV from a statistical perspective allows us to provide DOT&E with customized test plans, beyond what is available in MIL-STD-414. We plan to submit this article to a statistics journal. This paper Design of Experimentss not include any real test data, and Design of Experimentss not mention any specific program by name.
