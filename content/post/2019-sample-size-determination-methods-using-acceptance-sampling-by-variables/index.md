Acceptance Sampling by Variables (ASbV) is a statistical testing technique used in Personal Protective Equipment programs to determine the quality of the equipment in First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests. This article intends to remedy the lack of existing references that discuss the similarities between ASbV and certain techniques used in different sub-disciplines within statistics. Understanding ASbV from a statistical perspective allows testers to create customized test plans, beyond what is available in MIL-STD-414.
