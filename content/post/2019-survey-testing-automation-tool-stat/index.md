### Abstract

In operational testing, survey administration is typically a manual, paper-driven process. We have developed a web-based tool called Survey Testing Automation Tool (STAT), which integrates and automates survey construction, administration, and analysis procedures. STAT introduces a standardized approach to the construction of surveys and includes capabilities for survey management, survey planning, and form generation.
