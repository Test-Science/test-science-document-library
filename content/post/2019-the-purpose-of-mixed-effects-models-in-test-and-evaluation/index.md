Mixed-effects models are the standard technique for analyzing data with grouping structure. In defense testing, these models are useful because they allow us to account for correlations between observations, a feature common in many operational tests. In this article, we describe the advantages of modeling data from a mixed-effects perspective and discuss an R package—ciTools—that equips the user with easy methods for presenting results from this type of model.
