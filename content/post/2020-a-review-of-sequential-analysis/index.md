### Abstract
Sequential analysis concerns statistical evaluation in situations in which the number, pattern, or composition of the data is not determined at the start of the investigation, but instead depends upon the information acquired throughout the course of the investigation. Expanding the use of sequential analysis has the potential to save a lot of money and reduce test time (National Research Council, 1998). This paper summarizes the literature on sequential analysis and offers fundamental information for providing recommendations for its use in DoD test and evaluation.
