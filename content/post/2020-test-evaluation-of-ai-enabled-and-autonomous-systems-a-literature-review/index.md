We summarize a subset of the literature regarding the challenges to and recommendations for the test, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEV&V) of autonomous military systems. This literature review is meant for informational purposes only and does not make any recommendations of its own. A synthesis of the literature identified the following categories of TEV&V challenges  

1. Problems arising from the complexity of autonomous systems, 

2. Challenges imposed by the structure of the current acquisition system, 

3. Lack of methods, tools, and infrastructure for testing, 

4. Novel safety and security issues, 

5. A lack of consensus on policy, standards, and metrics, 

6. Issues around how to integrate humans into the operation and testing of these systems. 

Recommendations for how to test autonomous military systems can be sorted into five broad groups  

1. Use certain processes for writing requirements, or for designing and developing systems, 

2. Make targeted investments to develop methods or tools, improve our test infrastructure, or enhance our workforce's AI skillsets, 

3. Use specific proposed test frameworks, 

4. Employ novel methods for system safety or cybersecurity, and

5. Adopt specific proposed policies, standards, or metrics.
