As the Department of Defense acquires new systems with artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous (AI&A) capabilities, the test and evaluation (T&E) community will need to adapt to the challenges that these novel technologies present. The goals listed in this AI Roadmap address the broad range of tasks that the T&E community will need to achieve in order to properly test, evaluate, verify, and validate AI-enabled and autonomous systems. It includes issues that are unique to AI and autonomous systems, as well as legacy T&E shortcomings that will be compounded by newer technologies.
