### Abstract
Qualitative data, captured through free-form comment boxes, interviews, focus groups, and activity observation is heavily employed in testing and evaluation (T&E). The qualitative research approach can offer many benefits, but knowledge of how to implement methods, collect data, and analyze data according to rigorous qualitative research standards is not broadly understood within the T&E community. This tutorial offers insight into the foundational concepts of method and practice that embody defensible approaches to qualitative research. We discuss where qualitative data comes from, how it can be captured, what kind of value it offers, and how to capitalize on that value through methods and best practices.
