### Abstract

Reliability estimators for a two-component system with standby component redundancy conceptually can be based either on the proportion of observed system-level successes or on the empirical probability of individual component successes.  Intuitively, the latter approach is preferable since it incorporates more statistical information.  The relative methodological merits are less obvious, however, for the missing data situation when system success records are not accompanied by a complete accounting of all component outcomes.  For both the complete and missing data cases, we examine the two alternative estimation schemes, discuss exact and asymptotic properties, and report simulation results.  The missing data construct invokes the expectation-maximization algorithm to derive a closed-form maximum likelihood estimator that, when parameterized in terms of the extensiveness of the component-level data, embodies both complete-data estimators as limiting cases.
