### Abstract

The Department of Defense (DoD) develops and acquires some of the worldâ€™s most advanced and sophisticated systems. As new technologies emerge and are incorporated into systems, OSD/DOT&E faces the challenge of ensuring that these systems undergo adequate and efficient test and evaluation (T&E) prior to operational use. Statistical engineering is a collaborative, analytical approach to problem solving that integrates statistical thinking, methods, and tools with other relevant disciplines. The statistical engineering process provides better solutions to large, unstructured, real-world problems and supports rigorous decision-making. In this talk, we provide two case study examples related to looking at ways to improve approaches to integrate testing and data collection across the full system lifecycle. These case studies highlight why we believe statistical engineers are necessary for successful T&E.
