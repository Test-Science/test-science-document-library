### Abstract
In the acquisition and testing world, data analysts repeatedly encounter certain categories of data, such as time or distance until an event (e.g., failure, alert, detection), binary outcomes (e.g., success/failure, hit/miss), and survey responses. Analysts need tools that enable them to produce quality and timely analyses of the data they acquire during testing. This poster presents four web-based apps that can analyze these types of data. The apps are designed to assist analysts and researchers with simple repeatable analysis tasks, such as building summary tables and plots for reports or briefings. Using software tools like these apps can inclease repti)ducibility of results, timeliness of analysis and reporting, attractiveness and standardization of aesthetics in figures, and accuracy of results. The first app models reliability ofa system or component by fitting parametric statistical distributions to time-to-failure data. The second app fits a logistic regression model to binary data with one or two independent continuous variables as The third calculates summary statistics and produces plots of groups of Likert-scale survey question responses. The fourth calculates the system usability scale (SUS) scores for SUS survey responses and enables the app user to plot scores versus an independent variable. These apps are available for public use on the Test Science Interactive Tools webpage https //testscience.org/interactive-tools/.
