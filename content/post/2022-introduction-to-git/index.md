### Abstract
Version control software manages, archives, and (optionally) distributes different versions of files. The most popular program for version control is Git, which serves as the backbone of websites such as Github, Bitbucket, and others. In this mini- tutorial, we will introduce basics of version control in general, and Git in particular. We explain what role Git plays in a reproducible research context. The goal of the course is to get participants started using Git. We will create and clone repositories, add and track files in a repository, and manage Git branches. We also discuss a few Git best practices.
