### Abstract
Effective training of the broad set of users/operators of systems has downstream impacts on usability, workload, and ultimate system performance that are related to mission success. In order to measure training effectiveness, we designed a survey called the Operational Assessment of Training Scale (OATS) in partnership with the Army Test and Evaluation Center (A TEC). Two subscales were designed to assess the degrees to which training covered relevant content for real operations (Relevance subscale) and enabled self-rated ability to interact with systems effectively after training (Efficacy subscale). The full list of 15 items were given to over 700 users/operators across a range of military systems and test events (comprising both developmental and operational testing phases). Systems included vehicles, aircraft, C3 systems, and dismounted squad equipment, among other types. We evaluated reliability of the factor structure across these military samples using confirmatory factor analysis. We confirmed that OATS exhibited a two-factor structure for training relevance and training efficacy. Additionally, a shortened, six-item measure of the OATS with three items per subscale continues to fit observed data well, allowing for quicker assessments of training. We discuss various ways that the OATS can be applied to one-off, multi-day, multi-event, and other types of training events. Additional OATS details and information about other scales for test and evaluation are available at the Institute for Defense Analyses' website, https //testscience.org/validated-scales-repository/.
