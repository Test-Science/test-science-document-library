### Abstract
Following Wojton's research on the Trust of Automated Systems Test (TOAST), which is designed to measure how much a human trusts an automated system, we aimed to determine how well this scale performs when not used in a military context. We found that participants who used a poorly performing automated system trusted the system less than expected when using that system on a case by case basis, however, those who used a high performing system trusted the system the same as they expected. Additionally, both participants who used the poorly performing system and those who used the high performing system lost a significant amount of trust after using the system on a group case basis. These results indicate that having a high performance system is important for trust, but only when the user has the ability to decide to trust or distrust the system on a case-by-case basis.
