It is often said that many research findings -- from social sciences, medicine, economics, and other disciplines -- are false. This fact is trumpeted in the media and by many statisticians. There are several reasons that false research is published, but to what extent should we be worried about them in defense testing and modeling and simulation? In this talk I will present several recommendations for actions that statisticians and data scientists can take to improve the quality of our validations and evaluations.
