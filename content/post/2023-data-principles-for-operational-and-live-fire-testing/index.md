### Abstract
Many DOD systems undergo operational testing, which is a field test involving realistic combat conditions. Data, analysis, and reporting are the fundamental outcomes of operational test, which support leadership decisions. The importance of data standardization and interoperability is widely recognized by leadership in DoD, however, there are no generally recognized standards for the management and handling of data (format, pedigree, architecture, transferability, etc.) in the DOD. In this presentation, I will review a set of data principles that we believe DOD should adopt to improve how it manages test data. I will explain the current state of data management, each of the data principles, why the DOD should adopt them, and some of the difficulties of improving data handling.
