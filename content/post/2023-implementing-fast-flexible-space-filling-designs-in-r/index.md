### Abstract

Modeling and simulation (M&S) can be a useful tool when testers and evaluators need to augment the data collected during a test event. When planning M&S, testers use experimental design techniques to determine how much and which types of data to collect, and they can use space-filling designs to spread out test points across the operational space. Fast flexible space-filling designs (FFSFDs) are a type of space-filling design useful for M&S because they work well in design spaces with disallowed combinations and permit the inclusion of categorical factors. IDA analysts developed a function to create FFSFDs using the free statistical software R. To our knowledge, there are no R packages for creating an FFSFD that can accommodate a variety of user inputs, such as categorical factors. Moreover, users of IDAâ€™s function can share their code to make their work reproducible.
