### Abstract

This workshop instructs attendees on how to run an end-to-end optimal Design of Experiments workflow in R using the open source skpr package. This workshop is split into two sections  optimal design generation and design evaluation. The first half of the workshop provides basic instructions how to use R, as well as how to use skpr to create an optimal design for an experiment  how to specify a model, create a candidate set of potential runs, remove disallowed combinations, and specify the design generation conditions to best suit an experimenter's goals.  The second half of the workshop covers design evaluation with skpr  how to determine if an experimental design is adequate for the test at hand. The workshop provides information on how to perform power calculations and evaluate other design properties that affect design quality. This also includes instruction on how to generate fraction of design space plots and correlation plots.
