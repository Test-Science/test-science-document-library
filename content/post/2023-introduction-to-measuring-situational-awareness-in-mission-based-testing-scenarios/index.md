### Abstract

Situation Awareness (SA) plays a key role in decision making and human performance, higher operator SA is associated with increased operator performance and decreased operator errors. While maintaining or improving “situational awareness” is a common requirement for systems under test, there is no single standardized method or metric for quantifying SA in operational testing (OT). This leads to varied and sometimes suboptimal treatments of SA measurement across programs and test events. This paper introduces Endsley’s three-level model of SA in dynamic decision making, a frequently used model of individual SA, reviews trade-offs in some existing measures of SA, and discusses a selection of potential ways in which SA measurement during OT may be improved.
