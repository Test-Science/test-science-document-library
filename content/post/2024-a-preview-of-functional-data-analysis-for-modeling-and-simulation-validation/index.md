### Abstract
Modeling and simulation (M&S) validation for operational testing often involves comparing live data with simulation outputs. Statistical methods known as functional data analysis (FDA) provides techniques for analyzing large data sets ("large" meaning that a single trial has a lot of information associated with it), such as radar tracks. We preview how FDA methods could assist M&S validation by providing statistical tools handling these large data sets. This may facilitate analyses that make use of more of the data available and thus allows for better detection of differences between M&S predictions and live test results. We demonstrate some fundamental FDA approaches with a notional example of live and simulated radar tracks of a bomberâ€™s flight
