This presentation documents the work of IDA 2024 Summer Associate Emma Mitchell. The work presented details an R Shiny application developed to provide a user-friendly software tool for researchers to use in planning for and analyzing system reliability. Specifically, the presentation details how one can plan for a reliability test using Bayesian Reliability Assurance test methods. Such tests utilize supplementary data and information, including reliability models, prior test results, expert judgment, and knowledge of environmental conditions, to plan for reliability testing, which in turn can often help in reducing the required amount of testing. In the planning phase, the application enables researchers to use Bayesian methods to incorporate supplementary data when determining appropriate test lengths. In the analysis phase, the tool allows researchers to combine information through Bayesian methods, resulting in better uncertainty quantification than traditional methods.
