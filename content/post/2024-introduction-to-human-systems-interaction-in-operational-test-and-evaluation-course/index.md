    Human-System Interaction (HSI) is the study of interfaces between humans and technical systems. The Department of Defense incorporates HSI evaluations into defense acquisition to improve system performance and reduce lifecycle costs. During operational test and evaluation, HSI evaluations characterize how a systemâ€™s operational performance is affected by its users. The goal of this course is to provide the theoretical background and practical tools necessary to plan and evaluate HSI test plans, collect and analyze HSI data, and report on HSI results. We will discuss HSI concepts, measurement methods, design of experiments, data analysis, and evaluation and reporting, all from an operational testing perspective.
