Many Department of Defense (DoD) systems aim to increase or maintain Situational Awareness (SA) at the individual or group level. In some cases, maintenance or enhancement of SA is listed as a primary function or requirement of the system. However, during test and evaluation SA is examined inconsistently or is not measured at all. Situational Awareness Linked Indicators Adapted to Novel Tasks (SALIANT) is an empirically-based methodology meant to measure SA at the team, or group, level. While research using the SALIANT model suggests that it effectively quantifies team SA, no study has examined the effectiveness of SALIANT across the entirety of the existing empirical research.  The aim of the current work is to conduct a meta-analysis of previous research to examine the overall reliability of SALIANT as an SA measurement tool. This meta-analysis will assess when and how SALIANT can serve as a reliable indicator of performance at testing. Additional applications of SALIANT in non-traditional operational testing domains will also be discussed.
