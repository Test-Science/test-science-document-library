Space-filling designs (SFDs) are a rigorous method for designing modeling and simulation (M&S) studies. However, they are hindered by their requirement to choose the final sample size prior to testing. Sequential designs are an alternative that can increase test efficiency by testing small amounts of data at a time. We have conducted a literature review of existing sequential space-filling designs and found the methods most applicable to the test and evaluation (T&E) community.
