### Abstract

A vulnerability assessment of a combat vehicle uses modeling and simulation (M&S) to predict the vehicle's vulnerability to a given enemy attack. The system-level output of the M&S is the probability that the vehicle's mobility is degraded as a result of the attack. The M&S models this system-level phenomenon by decoupling the attack scenario into a hierarchy of sub-systems. Each sub-system addresses a specific scientific problem, such as the fracture dynamics of an exploded munition, or the ballistic resistance provided by the vehicle's armor. For each sub-system in the hierarchy, laboratory testing is conducted to gather data to fit a subsystem-level model.  The M&S hierarchically interconnects the subsystem-level models to enable prediction of the system-level output. As part of the DoD's ongoing effort to improve M&S using verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification, we present a case study that propagates the uncertainties in the hierarchy of sub-models to the system-level output.
